                <h2>Solar Radiation Modification</h2>
                <P>Geoengineering is a way we could try to cool the planet or remove carbon dioxide from the air. One approach is Solar Radiation Modification
                    (SRM), which includes reflecting sunlight back to space to cool Earth. Techniques include spraying reflective particles into the atmosphere
                    or enhancing cloud brightness. While SRM could potentially lower global temperatures quickly, it does not addres the root cause of climate change
                    (excessive greenhouse gas emissions) and instead acts like a temporary fix. Currently, SRM methods are largely theoretical and have not been 
                    implemented on a global scale.
                </P>

                  <h2>Carbon dioxide Removal</h2>
                  <P>Another approach is Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), which aims to actually reduce carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It is performed by planting lots of trees,
                    using machines that capture carbon dioxide, or fertilizing ocens to help tiny plants absorb carbon. While slower to show effects than SRM, CDR targets the root 
                    cause of climate change. Some small projects exist, but large-scale implementatio is still theoretical

                <h2>When could it work?</h2>
                <P>
                    SRM could have rapid effects in months to a few years, while CDR takes decades to noticeably reduce carbon dioxide levels. However, all methods carry
                    uncertainties, and we do not fully know the unintended consequences. Since most of the methods are theoretical, these timelines are estimates and not guarantees.

                <P>
                    Geoengineering might help slow climate change, but it raises serious ethical questions. Who should decide if and when these methods are used? a single person? a country?
                   the UN? Relying on geoengineering could reduce the urgency to cut emmissions, but what if this is a shortcut that will backfire? What if one region benefits while another 
                   suffers unintended consequences like droughts or floods?
                </P>
                <P>
                   Ask yourself: if we could implement a fix, would you take the risk, knowing the outcomes might hit someone else severely? While this solution seems helpful, we currently 
                   lack the data to say with certainty that it doesn't cause more problems than it solves. These questions highlight why geoengineering is complex and controversial.
